Ripstrike
=========

Desktop Java Game

I started this game over the summer of 2012 before starting college. As a last hurrah of working
in Java, since I wanted to move over to XNA and other Microsoft technologies, I made a platformer/
shooter kind of game that had more sophisticated terrain, a certain level of AI, and a greater variety
of parameters/options to play the game. I also wanted better graphics!

Again, the WASD keys control the character, and you shoot with the left mouse button. You can jump with
space and throw grenades with the right mouse button as well. There's only free for all and team deathmatch
implemented. Again, the game is pretty playable although it is lacking. I spent a lot of time on the graphics
and making a seperate map editing program.

The project was done in Eclipse, back with Java SE 1.6.

All graphics and image assets are mine: I made all of them.
